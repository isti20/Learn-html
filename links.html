    <!-- HTML Links - Hyperlinks
    HTML links are hyperlinks.
    You can click on a link and jump to another document.
    When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

    Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element! -->

    <!-- HTML Links - Syntax
    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
    The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
    <a href="url">link text</a> -->

    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

    <br><hr>

    <!-- HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
    To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    
    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window -->

    <!-- Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
    Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
    A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part): -->
    <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

    <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://webstockreview.net/images/facebook-clipart-app-4.png">FB Images</a></p>
    <p><a href="image/icon_ig.png">IG images</a></p>

    <br><hr>

    <!-- HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
    To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag: -->
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/"><img src="image/icon_ig.png" alt="Instagram" style="width:42px;height:42px;"></a>

    <br><hr>

    <!-- Link to an Email Address
    Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email): -->
    <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

    <br><hr>

    <!-- Button as a Link -->
    <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

    <br><hr>

    <!-- Link Titles
    The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. 
    The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element. -->
